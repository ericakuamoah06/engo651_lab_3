# Project 3 Calgary Building Permit WebApp

ENGO 651 - ERIC aKUAMOAH

### Project Description
In Project 3, we develop a straightforward web application that allows users to access information on building permits issued by the City of Calgary.

#### The project repository contains the following files:

* index.html: Incorporates a date picker and a submit button, in addition to importing necessary libraries and styles.
* style.css: Defines the map's height adjustments.

* There is a script element in the Manages the map's initialization, search functionality, clustering, marker placement, and other interactive features.

* Initially, the map displays the City of Calgary. Users can search for building permits within a specified start and end date, which will be indicated on the map with markers. Interacting with a marker will trigger a pop-up box that provides detailed information about the building permit, including the issue date, work class group, contractor name, community name, and the original address.

To enhance visualization and readability, especially in scenarios where multiple permits are issued at the same location or markers are closely positioned at certain zoom levels, the application utilizes markercluster in leaflet.
